The first update to Gambattye comes with lots of fundamental changes and improvements, including:

- Major sound improvements, including proper resampling.
- Allow controls to be customised, from a new preferences window.
- Enable console selection (between Game Boy Color (Auto), Original Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance).
- Allow emulated sound to be muted.
- When quitting, ensure that save data is properly saved. Previously, this would only happen when closing a window.
- Include automatic update checks.
- When using a modifier key as part of the controls, map all modifier keys to this button. For example, by default, both shift keys work as the Select button.
- Add backwards compatibility for OS X 10.11, in addition to macOS 10.12.
- Store preferences (sound and console) for each ROM in their extended attributes.
