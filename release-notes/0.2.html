<p>The first update to Gambattye comes with lots of fundamental changes and improvements, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Major sound improvements, including proper resampling.</li>
<li>Allow controls to be customised, from a new preferences window.</li>
<li>Enable console selection (between Game Boy Color (Auto), Original Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance).</li>
<li>Allow emulated sound to be muted.</li>
<li>When quitting, ensure that save data is properly saved. Previously, this would only happen when closing a window.</li>
<li>Include automatic update checks.</li>
<li>When using a modifier key as part of the controls, map all modifier keys to this button. For example, by default, both shift keys work as the Select button.</li>
<li>Add backwards compatibility for OS X 10.11, in addition to macOS 10.12.</li>
<li>Store preferences (sound and console) for each ROM in their extended attributes.</li>
</ul>
