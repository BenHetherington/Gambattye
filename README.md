Gambattye is a Game Boy Color emulator for macOS, powered by a [fork](https://github.com/Ben10do/gambatte) of [Gambatte](https://github.com/sinamas/gambatte). It's a native Mac app, unlike Gambatte's QT or SDL frontends.

At present, the core emulation works just fine. Additional features and customisation options aren't yet available, but I'm certainly planning on adding more to this in the future.

## Building
Run [`pod install`](https://cocoapods.org), then open Xcode and build as you'd expect. `libgambatte` will be automatically built if necessary â€“ just make sure that you clone the submodules when cloning Gambattye!

## Controls
The controls can be customised in the Preferences. By default, they are currently based on bgb's, and are:

| Game Boy | Keyboard   |
| -------- | ---------- |
| D-Pad    | Arrow keys |
| A        | S          |
| B        | A          |
| START    | Enter      |
| SELECT   | Shift      |
